Hearty warm welcome to GCEK!!!

Established in 1960, the institute in last 55 years has blossomed into a major education centre essentially due to the combined efforts of a very dedicated team of staff and students who are committed to the overall development of institute. The institute has produced outstanding engineers, who have successfully proved their professional competence in their respective disciplines. The institute lays special emphasis on human values, ethics, apart from academic excellence. Affiliated to Shivaji University Kolhapur, the institute offers UG Programs in Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Information Technology and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering and PG Programs in Structural Engineering, Construction Management, Heat Power, Production Engineering and Power System besides the MCA course. All the courses are recognized by AICTE and Government of Maharashtra. Three UG programs are accredited by NBA previously for which the institute has applied for re-accreditation along with the fresh accreditation of remaining programs. The institute is participating in prestigious Govt. of India project, TEQIP II since 2012. The institute has gained autonomous status from academic year 2015-16 and decided to implement autonomy for first year and subsequently for higher classes. The institute has applied for re-accreditation of 3 UG courses and fresh accreditation of 2 UG and 6 PG courses.

As a priority of decentralization, institute has some key positions like Dean Academics, Dean R&D, Dean industry interaction and Dean student affairs who take care of overall development of students. The departments are equipped with excellent laboratory facilities. The Central library has over 58525 text / reference books in all the disciplines of engineering.The institute houses all the facilities for education, extra curricular and sports activities in environment friendly campus. The institute also has Gymkhana for nurturing student's co-curricular skills. Besides, every department has its own student association managed exclusively by students for arranging various co-curricular events. "Aavishkar", a National level technical competition, managed by students, showcases their managerial and technical skills. The students have brought laurels to the institute by bagging several awards in technical meets and sports competitions.

The faculty of the institute has received substantial grants from AICTE under MODROB, TAPTEC and IIPC schemes and earned revenue through testing and consultancy over the last 10 years. The faculty is actively involved in guiding UG, PG and PhD students in their research areas. The institute has formulated training policy under faculty development plan to address the training needs. The huge number of training programs organised by the faculty and also their participation in recent time has been noteworthy.
